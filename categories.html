          <span>LOVE ROSIE </span> ..This was such a cute book! Although this
          was a pretty long book for a contemporary, it covered the lives of
          Rosie and Alex from ages 5 to 50 and I remained interested in their
          story the whole time. I loved these two characters but at the same
          time I wanted to smack them over the head several times for being so
          stupid. As for the writing style, it is written in the forms of
          letters, emails, chat rooms (hahaha who even uses those even more?)
          and instant messages. This took me a while to get into because at
          times I felt like it was difficult to understand how much time had
          passed since the last section and sometimes I felt that I couldn't
          fully connect to the characters. However, I eventually got used to the
          writing and it actually made it a quicker read than if it was just
          plain narrative prose. Also, the epilogue wrapped the story up so
          well! I had so much fun reading this book and I can't wait to watch
          the movie with Lily Collins and Sam Claflin (even though I hear it is
          pretty much nothing like the book).

        <article>
          <span>WUTHERING HEIGHTS</span> ..Wuthering Heights takes us to a world
          that is somehow outside of all social and moral norms. It's closer to
          the realm of dreams or Greek myth than the rational everyday life of
          civilised habit. As if the characters are dramatizing the psyche or
          the unconscious in the midst of everyday life. Bronte demands we
          extend our sympathies beyond their brightly-lit habitual moral
          parameters - rather like Nabokov does in Lolita. Except where Nabokov
          does it directly through his narrator Bronte is arguably cleverer by
          providing us with a rather commonplace and reasonable narrator who
          much more mirrors our own sensibility. Nelly is like a comfortable
          armchair. You might say the norm in this novel is sociopathic
          behaviour and yet Nelly with her commonplace emotional economies
          provides the illusion that everything she recounts is firmly attached
          to a normal social reality. It's a super clever sleight of hand on
          Bronte's part. Thus this is a conventional secular narrative we
          experience in Nelly's armchair about a violent amoral world in which
          almost everything is outside the realm of civilised etiquette.

          <span>THE GREAT GATSBY</span>..The Great Gatsby is your neighbor
          you're best friends with until you find out he's a drug dealer. It
          charms you with some of the most elegant English prose ever published,
          making it difficult to discuss the novel without the urge to stammer
          awestruck about its beauty. It would be evidence enough to argue that
          F. Scott Fitzgerald was superhuman, if it wasn't for the fact that we
          know he also wrote This Side of Paradise.

          <span>Pride and Prejudice</span>.. Since its immediate success in
          1813, Pride and Prejudice has remained one of the most popular novels
          in the English language. Jane Austen called this brilliant work "her
          own darling child" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, "as
          delightful a creature as ever appeared in print." The romantic clash
          between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a
          splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant
          wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of
          flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of
          manners of Regency England.

          <span>Don Quixote </span> ..Whatever else Don Quixote may be, I never
          found it boring. Parts of it were very funny, others had wonderful
          similarities with Shakespeare, some bits were more serious: it's like
          a mini library in a single volume. Wonderful. Overall, it has quite a
          Shakespearean feel - more in the plotting and tales within tales (eg
          The Man Who was Recklessly Curious, stolen by Mozart for Cosi fan
          Tutte) than the language. In fact, the story of Cardenio is thought to
          be the basis for Shakespeare's lost play of the same name.

        <article>
          <span>1984 Novel</span>.. This book is far from perfect. Its
          characters lack depth, its rhetoric is sometimes didactic, its plot
          (well, half of it anyway) was lifted from Zumyatin’s We, and the
          lengthy Goldstein treatise shoved into the middle is a flaw which
          alters the structure of the novel like a scar disfigures a face. But
          in the long run, all that does not matter, because George Orwell got
          it right. Orwell, a socialist who fought against Franco, watched
          appalled as the great Soviet experiment was reduced to a totalitarian
          state, a repressive force equal in evil to Fascist Italy or Nazi
          Germany. He came to realize that ideology in an authoritarian state is
          nothing but a distraction, a shiny thing made for the public to stare
          at. He came to realize that the point of control was more control, the
          point of torture was more torture, that the point of all their
          "alternative facts" was to fashion a world where people would no
          longer possess even a word for truth.

          <span>animal farm</span> ..ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL BUT SOME ARE MORE
          EQUAL THAN OTHERS ! In the start, I thought this book would be from
          the view point of animals; about how they are treated, how they expect
          to be treated and how man is cruel towards them. But but but; I am
          amazed at how Orwell criticizes the political maneuvers and
          totalitarian rule, using animals to explain what humans do. The author
          beautifully portrays the way a revolution is started to stop what is
          happening and going full circle comes to the same point it started
          from. Just the face of power is changed. This book tells how the
          ruling class makes fool of the working class, uses their energies and
          resources for their own pleasure. What happens behind the closed doors
          of power.

          <span>THE Green mile</span>..The Green Mile is a 1996 serial novel by
          American writer Stephen King. It tells the story of death row
          supervisor Paul Edgecombe's encounter with John Coffey, an unusual
          inmate who displays inexplicable healing and empathetic abilities. The
          book is an example of magical realism. Featuring a first-person
          narrative told by Paul Edgecombe, the novel switches between Paul as
          an old man in the Georgia Pines nursing home writing down his story in
          1996, and his time in 1932 as the block supervisor of the Cold
          Mountain Penitentiary death row, nicknamed "The Green Mile" for the
          color of the floor's linoleum.

        <article>
          <span>crime and punishment </span> ..There was a time in my life when
          I couldn’t get enough of reading Dostoevsky. Maybe because his books
          made me think so deeply about being human and how we choose to live
          our lives. I began with Crime and Punishment, probably the work he is
          best known for. What I remember is being fascinated by Dostoevsky’s
          brilliant understanding of human nature. I remember thinking what a
          deep study this book was; an incredible examination of a man who
          commits murder and how he is “punished” for it.

          <span>the brothers karamazov</span>.. If there was still any doubt,
          let me confirm that this actually is the greatest book ever written.
          But be warned that you need to set aside a solid month to get through
          it. And it's not light reading--this is a dense work of philosophy
          disguised as a simple murder mystery. But it's well worth the effort.
          It tackles the fundamental question of human existence--how best to
          live one's life--in a truly engaging way. Dostoevsky created 3
          brothers (Ivan, Alexei, and Dmitri) with opposite answers to this
          fundamental question, and set them loose in the world to see what
          would happen. A testament to Dostoevsky's genius is he didn't know how
          the book would evolve when he started writing. As a consequence, the
          book really isn't about the plot at all, but about how these brothers
          evolve and deal with their struggles based on their differing world
          views.

          times in the 1930s. The exhausting search for work, food and a roof
          over the head, put a strain on human dignity, and degrade the soul,
          making unexpected even genuine attitudes of solidarity by those who
          share the same destiny. But hunger and very poor living conditions sow
          grains of desperation, from which gems of gall immediately sprout.

          dreading reading for quite some time. It was on a list of books that
          I'd been working my way through and, after seeing the size of it and
          the fact that 'War And Peace' was voted #1 book to avoid reading, I
          was reluctant to ever get started. But am I glad that I did. This is a
          surprisingly fast-moving, interesting and easy to read novel. The last
          of which I'd of never believed could be true before reading it, but
          you find yourself instantly engrossed in this kind of Russian soap
          opera, filled with weird and intriguing characters. The most notable
          theme is the way society overlooked mens' affairs but frowned on
          womens', this immediately created a bond between myself and Anna, who
          is an extremely likeable character.

          <span>the shawshank redemption</span>.. Shawshank Redemption its been
          recommended to me by a friend and then I've read about it in an
          article. I couldn't wait to get my hands on it (I can't remember
          seeing the movie). I have ordered it on Amazon and had no ideea I've
          bought the book Different Seasons. I thought I'm reading Shawshank
          Redemption and the I realised there's 4 stories in this book. Towards
          the end of it I realised there's even more than 4. There's stories in
          stories, which I loved! Each and every little one. I'm aware of the
          fact not lots of people like Stephen King, I don't know why. Maybe
          because of the crude, horror style. If you're not into that you should
          skip it. For me was one of those books which you can't put down, but
          sometimes you just have to and you look back at it and think "I'll get
          back to you as soon as I can!!". I was happy to read something else
          than love stories for a change. And he's good enough to get you hooked
          right from the begining of the story and make sure you will come back
          over and over till you finish it. They can all finish in a thousand
          ways, it's hard to predict what's going to happen. And that is
          brilliant. To keep this short - I loved it!
